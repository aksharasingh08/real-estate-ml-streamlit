\# Real Estate Price Predictor for California



This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts median house values in California districts, based on the California Housing dataset. The final product is an interactive web application built with Streamlit, where users can input housing features and receive a real-time price prediction.



Virtual environment was optional for this project.



\## 🚀 Features



\- \*\*Interactive UI\*\*: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, featuring sliders and number inputs for all features.

\- \*\*Real-Time Predictions\*\*: Utilizes a pre-trained `RandomForestRegressor` model to deliver predictions instantly.

\- \*\*Data-Driven\*\*: The model was trained and tuned on the classic California Housing dataset from `scikit-learn`.

\- \*\*Reproducible\*\*: The entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and deployment, is documented in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook.



\## 🛠️ Tech Stack \& Libraries



\- \*\*Language\*\*: Python 3

\- \*\*Machine Learning\*\*: Scikit-learn

\- \*\*Data Manipulation\*\*: Pandas, NumPy

\- \*\*Web Framework\*\*: Streamlit

\- \*\*Model Persistence\*\*: Joblib
